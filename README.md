# Crypto Tracker
Crypto Tracker is the first project that I created using a React framework,Next.js. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become very popular lately and I thought it is a good ideea to create a website where you can see important information about them. You can see how much it is worth 1 of every coin in USD, how much it has gone up or down in the last 24h, and if you click on it you will be sent to a page where you will see only that coin's information. I have learned a lot building this site including basics of React and Next.js, fetching data from an API and how to use a React library like Framer Motion.
